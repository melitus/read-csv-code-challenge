## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

# clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/melitus/read-csv-code-challenge.git
```

# Change directory

```
cd server
```

# Install NPM dependencies

```
yarn install
```

# start the server

yarn run dev

I used postman to test the api.
To use postman, go to the project doc folder and import the docs file into your postman client to ease the testing
